# Tutorial Playlist — Build-and-Run Sessions

## Philosophy

Each session builds **one runnable thing**. You can stop after any session and have working code. Later sessions add capabilities without breaking earlier ones.

Sessions 1–5 build infrastructure (no AI). Sessions 6–10 add agents. Sessions 11–12 add resources. Sessions 13–15 are integration, resilience, and evaluation.

## Session List

| # | Title | What you build | What you can run |
|---|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 01 | World Engine + Grid | Terrain grid, cell states, environment, tick loop | `engine.tick()` → print snapshot |
| 02 | Domain Physics — Fire Spread | FirePhysicsModule, ignition, spread rules | Ignite a cell, watch fire spread across grid |
| 03 | Sensors — Noisy Observations | SensorBase subclasses, emit(), SensorEvent | Read sensors, compare to ground truth |
| 04 | Sensor Inventory + Publisher | SensorInventory, SensorPublisher, failure modes | `publisher.run()` → events into a queue |
| 05 | Event Queue + Bridge Consumer | SensorEventQueue, EventBridgeConsumer, async plumbing | Producer/consumer pipeline with logging callback |
| 06 | Cluster Agent — Stub Mode | LangGraph StateGraph, TypedDict state, stub nodes | Feed events → get AnomalyFinding output |
| 07 | Cluster Agent — LLM Mode | bind_tools, ToolNode, ReAct loop, conditional edges | Same inputs, LLM-powered classification |
| 08 | Full Sensor→Agent Pipeline | Wire publisher → queue → consumer → cluster agent | End-to-end: world ticks → findings |
| 09 | Supervisor Agent — Stub Mode | Send API fan-out, custom reducers, multi-agent | Feed findings → get ActuatorCommands |
| 10 | Supervisor Agent — LLM Mode | Two ReAct loops (assess + decide), tool composition | LLM correlates across clusters, decides actions |
| 11 | Resources — Preparedness Assets | ResourceBase, ResourceInventory, scenario knobs | Create resources, query readiness, degrade |
| 12 | Resources + Supervisor Tools | resource_tools, combined tool binding | Supervisor queries preparedness during assessment |
| 13 | Full Pipeline — Everything Wired | World → sensors → agents → supervisor → commands | Complete simulation with all components |
| 14 | Scenario Knobs — Preparedness Under Stress | Sensor failures, resource degradation, comparison | Same scenario, degraded conditions → different assessments |
| 15 | Evaluation — Preparedness Assessment Quality | Compare assessments to actual resource state | Gap detection, recommendation quality, degradation sensitivity |

## Gap Analysis

The 15 sessions cover the **foundational** and **mid-level** skills for Graph Primitives, Control Flow, Tools, and Multi-Agent well. But several rubric areas have no session:

### Gaps that could become additional sessions

| Gap | Rubric Level | Suggested Session |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| Checkpointers + crash recovery | mid-level | **16: Persistence — Checkpointers** |
| Cross-agent Store (read/write) | mid-level | **17: Cross-Agent Memory — Store** |
| interrupt() — pause and resume | mid-level | **18: Human-in-the-Loop — interrupt()** |
| Recursion limit + error handling | advanced | **19: Error Handling — Recursion Limits** |
| Tool errors + fallback | mid-level | **20: Tool Error Handling + Fallback** |

### Gaps that are explicitly "not yet" in rubric

These are noted in the rubric as aspirational — not bugs in the tutorial:

- **Long-term memory with pgvector** (advanced) — needs pgvector infrastructure
- **State schema evolution** (advanced) — rubric says "separate exercise"
- **Time travel / replay** (advanced) — rubric says "not yet, high value to add"
- **Agent handoff / swarm** (advanced) — rubric says "needs explicit scenario"
- **State editing before resume** (advanced) — rubric says "partial"
- **Custom callbacks** (advanced) — rubric says "partial"

### Recommendation

Add sessions **16–20** to cover the mid-level gaps. The advanced gaps are fine to leave as future work — the rubric itself marks them as aspirational.

The codebase already has the plumbing for sessions 16–17 (Store is wired into `report_findings` and `assess_situation`, `build_cluster_agent_graph` and `build_supervisor_graph` both accept `store` parameter). Session 18 requires adding `interrupt()` to the supervisor graph, which is a clean additive change.
